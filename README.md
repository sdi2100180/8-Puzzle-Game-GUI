#### [8-Puzzle Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) implemented in C, using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).

Given an initial 3x3 puzzle, the aim is to reach a specific goal-puzzle in the minimum number of moves. The user is provided with two options: either try to solve the puzzle on their own or let the computer solve it (A.I.) using [A* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#:~:text=*%2Dlike%20algorithm.-,Description,shortest%20time%2C%20etc.) and a Manhantann distance heuristic.

## How To Play
- Select a mode (using the mouse): either solve the puzzle yourself, or let the computer do it in the minumum number of moves.
- Give initial puzzle. Press number-keys 1-8 for the corresponding numbers and the SPACE bar for the blank tile. The puzzle is filled row-to-row from left to right.
- If you select the manual mode, using the arrow keys, you should try to solve the puzzle, reaching the goal state showed on the screen. *EXAMPLE: Pressing the UP arrow key, will move the tile below the blank one, upwards.*
- If you select the A.I. mode, press ENTER to generate the next move.

## Project Structure 

- `include`

  Contains needed header files for the use of raylib. 
  
- `lib`
